#  INSTRUCTIONS FOR:
#  Setting up a new environment on Sasquatch to support R analysis (esp single cell) 
#
#  May need to refer to quick start guide: http://gonzo/hpcGuide_dev/0_QuickStart.html  


# FIRST: 
#   log into HPC (Sasquatch) with username 
#   (optionally start a tmux session, though I would recommend not b/c I had weird issues with R during it) 
#   srun into your association
#   follow instructions for installing mamba (miniforge) here: http://gonzo/hpcGuide_dev/1-4_InstallingSoftware.html


# SECOND: 
#   on command line, run the following code, replacing "franks_lab" with whatever environment name you want


mamba create --name franks_lab gdal geos gcc hdf5 cmake

mamba install --name franks_lab -c conda-forge r-base=4.4.1
mamba install --name franks_lab -c conda-forge pkg-config
mamba install --name franks_lab -c conda-forge udunits2
mamba install --name franks_lab -c bioconda scrublet

mamba activate franks_lab



## Other notes :
#   proj and proj4 conflict; may need to uninstall and re-install the right one if you need. proj is default installed.
#   to see what packages are currently installed use:
#      mamba list --name franks_lab
